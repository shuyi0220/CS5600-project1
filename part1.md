# Part 1 - read/write/exit

Write a program which:
• reads a line of input from standard input (file descriptor 0)
• if the line starts with ‘q’, ‘u’, ‘i’, ‘t’ then exit
• otherwise print the line to standard output (file descriptor 1) and loop

You will need to implement the following in “part-1.c”:
• system call wrappers for read, write, and exit
• logic to read a line of input using read. (I suggest reading 1 byte at a time and sticking it in a buffer; if it’s ‘\n’
then add a zero on the end and you’re done)
• a function to print a string using write. (again I suggest doing it a byte at a time)
• a simple loop, with a check after reading a line to see if the user entered “quit”.
You can assume that input lines are never more than 200 bytes long. Remember that you can’t return from the main function – you have to call exit.
You’ll probably want to factor out readline and print, since you’ll need them as separate functions in parts 2 and 3. Remember that you can’t use any functions other than the ones that you write yourself. That means no printf – use
GDB for your debugging (and no strcmp for string comparisons, or malloc for allocating memory). 

## Compiling
You can compile part 1 with the command make part-1. You can “clean up” (i.e. delete the compiled executables and intermediate files) with the command make clean.

##Testing
You won’t need to do a lot of testing for this one - it either works or it doesn’t. Before you submit your work I would suggest you run it under valgrind, which will tell you if you’re reading or writing memory that you didn’t intend to:
user@linux:proj1$ valgrind ./part-1

##Submission
Your submission for this part will be the contents of “part-1.c” and any code you wrote for testing if it is in a different file. Include a README.txt file in the submission folder to indicate which files you have modified/created to finish part 1.
