# Part 3 - Context Switching
For this last part we’ll throw away the command loop, and we’ll load and run two processes which switch back and forth between each other:
```
user@linux:proj1$ ./part-3
program 1
program 2
program 1
program 2
program 1
program 2
program 1
%rax,-0x68(%rbp)
-0x68(%rbp),%rax
8
program 2
done
user@linux:proj1$
```
## Program loading
We’ll load two different programs, process1 and process2, at two different locations in memory. I would suggest modifying your load-and-execute function from Part 2 to (a) take an offset as a parameter, and (b) return the entry point rather than calling it. Don’t worry about unmapping the memory when you’re done - we’re just going to run things once and then exit, so Linux can clean everything up for us when we’re done.
## Context switching
We’ll need to allocate stacks for the two processes - 4096 bytes should be more than enough. You can either use global arrays:
```
char stack1[4096];
char stack2[4096];
```
or you can allocate them with mmap:
```
void *stack1 = mmap(0, len, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
```
(the zero address tells mmap to pick an unused address.)
We’ll use the setup_stack_0 from stack.c, and the switch_to function defined in switch.S:
```
extern void switch_to(void **location_for_old_sp, void *new_value);
extern void *setup_stack0(void *_stack, void *func);
```
setup_stack0 takes a pointer to the top of a region of memory (not the bottom - in our case we would pass stack1+4096), and returns a stack pointer which will cause switch_to to invoke func with no arguments.
We need to implement the following system calls: - yield12 - this switches from process 1 to 2 - yield21 - this switches from process 2 to 1 - uexit - this switches back to the original process stack (see below)
There are three different stacks - the original process stack that the operating system gave us, and the stacks we allocated for processes 1 and 2 - and we’ll need locations (global variables) for storing pointers to each of them. We’re going to switch from the OS stack to the process 1 stack; it will then switch to process 2, and they’ll switch back and forth a few times, then one of them will call uexit which will switch back to the main OS stack and we can call the real exit system call to finish up.
## Testing
There isn’t much to test here - there aren’t any parameters or variable inputs to the assignment, so it either runs to completion without crashing, generating the output shown above, or it doesn’t.
## Debugging
There’s a lot to debug here. Unfortunately, valgrind won’t be of much use for this part of the assignment, as the moment you switch the stack pointer it thinks you have a horrible bug.
You’ll want to use the same tricks for loading additional symbols - in this case you can load them for both the “process1” and “process2” executables - and for single-stepping by instruction.
Finally, you may find yourself crashing with this error:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
switch_to () at switch.S:34
34      mov  0(%rax),%rax
9

That’s an assert in the switch_to function, telling you that you’ve tried to switch to a bogus stack. Both setup_stack and switch_to leave a flag value on the top of the stack; if you try to switch to a stack that doesn’t have this flag, it crashes before the switch happens. (Once you switch stack pointers, there’s no way to tell where you called switch_to from, or to look at the variables in that function.)
## Submission
Your submission for this part will be the contents of “part-3.c” and any code you wrote for testing if it in a different file. Indicate in the README.txt file which files you have modified/created to finish part-2.
